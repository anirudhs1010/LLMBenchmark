# LLM Benchmark

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio. 
This web app benchmarks generated Gemini prompts with Llama, DeepSeek R1 from Perplexity, and Perplexity Sonar; also provides data analysis accordingly with a rubric. Current deployment is not functional because of Perplexity's API update and my subscription expiration from Perplexity Pro, maybe changed accordingly if other free API alternatives are available.
